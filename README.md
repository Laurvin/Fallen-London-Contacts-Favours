# Fallen-London-Contacts-Favours
Shows how many Favours you have for each faction and will also she the value for Taste of the Garden (if you have it) and the values for your Mantlepiece and Scrapbook items.

They are shown at either the side (below the Travel button) or the top of the page (in place of the Fallen London logo); click the compass icon to change between locations.

The Favours block will refresh any time you change tabs within Fallen London but can also be refreshed by clicking any of the (faction) icons except for the compass.

How it works: this script loads the page that gets shown when you click Contacts on the Myself page and then grabs the number of favours per faction.
